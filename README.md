## Installing

```
gem install artoo-sphero
```

## Using

```ruby
require 'artoo'

connection :sphero, :adaptor => :sphero, :port => '127.0.0.1:4567'
device :sphero, :driver => :sphero
  
work do
  @rolling = false

  every(3.seconds) do
    puts "Rolling..."
    sphero.roll 90, rand(360)
  end
end
```
## Connecting to Sphero

### OSX

The main steps are:
- Pair your computer and the Sphero
- Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local unix port
- Connect to the device via Artoo

First pair your computer and Sphero. You might be prompted for a passcode, but you do not need to enter it, sinec the Sphero does not check.

Once paired, use the `artoo connect scan` command to find out your connection info:

```
$ artoo connect scan
```

Now you are ready to connect to the Sphero using the socket, in this example port 4567:

```
artoo connect socat 4567 Sphero-WRW
```

### Ubuntu

The main steps are:
- Pair your computer and the Sphero
- Map your device to a unix port
- Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local unix port
- Connect to the device via Artoo

First pair your computer and Sphero. You might be prompted for a passcode, but you do not need to enter it, sinec the Sphero does not check.

Once paired, use the `artoo connect scan` command to find out your connection info:

```
$ artoo connect scan
Scanning ...
  00:06:66:4A:14:99 Sphero-WRW
```

Next, you need to bind the Sphero to the system port. In the above example, /dev/Sphero-WRW. The easiest way to do this is to use the `artoo connect bind` command:

```
artoo connect bind 00:06:66:4A:14:99 Sphero-WRW
```

Now you are ready to connect to the Sphero using the socket, in this example port 4567:

```
artoo connect socat 4567 Sphero-WRW
```
